== jQuery.ObservableField.js

This is a jQuery plugin that implements a way to observe form fields on a near real-time frequency,
instead of having to rely on blur (too cumbersome for the user) or keyup (does not account 
for pasting of values or programmettically entered values).

The frequency has to be specified in milliseconds.  (1 second = 1000 milliseconds)

Each onkeyup event resets the counter, so a frequency of more than 1000 milliseconds will result 
on a not very responsive interface.


== Installation

Make sure that jQuery is included before this plugin. Then 
include "jQuery.ObservableField.js" with the following code.

Assuming that you copied it on /js/:

    <script src="/js/jQuery.ObservableField.js"></script>

== Example

See example.html

== Kudos
